# Operators are special symbols that can perform arithmatic or logical operations.
1. Arithmatic Operations
  1. Addition (+)
  2. Subtraction (-)
  3. Multiplication (*)
  4. Division (/)
  5. Floor Division- its like greatest integer function of division (//)
  6. Modulus- Remainder (%)
  7. Exponent (**)
  Note: if any of the value is float output will be in float. In case of division output is float always.
  In case of Modulus operator remainder is positive if diviser is positive and it is negative if diviser is negative. Divident does not play any role here.
  
2. Logical Operators
  1. AND
  2. OR
  3. NOT
 Note: Logical Operators always returns Boolean (True or Flase)

3. Comparison/Relational Operators
  1. euqal to (==)
  2. Greater than (>)
  3. less than (<)
  4. greater than equal to (>=)
  5. less than equal to (<=)
  6. not equal to (!=)
 Note: Relational operators compares actuall values and returns boolean (True or False)
 Mostly used in conditional logics.
 
4. Assignment Operators
  1. =
  2. +=
  3. -=
  4. *=
  5. /=
  6. **=
  7. //=
  8. %=
 Note: Here new value is assign to the variable (on left hand side).

5. Membership Operators
  1. in - Check presence and returns True if present and False if not present.
  2. not in - Returns True if not present and False if present.
  
6. Identity Operators
  1. is - compares the memory address if same returns True
  2. is not - returns True if memory address is different and False if same
  
7. Bitwise Operators
